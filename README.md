# RemoteDoorLock

RemoteDoorLock is designed to be able to unlock and lock a door remotely using a 3D printed gear system on a deadbolt lock. Using an Arduino R4, we will create a service that can remotely connect to a computer using Bluetooth or Wifi. There will be a password system in place as a security function. Refer to webserv.cpp for code regarding connection functionality.

RemoteDoorLock is a project for our class CS410 in Boston University
